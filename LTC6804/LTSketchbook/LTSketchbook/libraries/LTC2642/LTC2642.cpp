LTC2642: 16-Bit DAC with SPI Interface

@verbatim

The LTC2641/LTC2642 are families of 16-,14 and 12-bit unbuffered voltage output
DACs. These DACs operate from 2.7V to 5.5V supply and are monotonic over
temperature.

They communicate via SPI interface. 16 bits of data are loaded through DIN
after a high-to-low transition of CS (MSB first). After 16 data bits have
been loaded into the serial input register, a low-to-high transition on CS
transfers the data to the 16-bit DAC latch, updating the DAC output.

For the 14-bit DACs, (LTC2641-14/LTC2642-14), the MSB remains in the same
(left-justified) position in the input 16-bit data word. Therefore, two
“don’t-care” bits must be loaded after the LSB, to make up the required
16 data bits. Similarly, for the 12-bit family members(LTC2641-12/LTC2642-12)
four “don’t-care” bits must follow the LSB.
